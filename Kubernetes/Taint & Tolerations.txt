Taints use for Node
Tolerations use for Pod

-- Create Taints 
kubectl taint nodes <node-name> <key>=<value>:<effect>
<node-name> → The name of the node.
<key> → A label key (e.g., environment).
<value> → A label value (e.g., production).
<effect> → The effect of the taint:
NoSchedule → New pods without a toleration will not be scheduled.
PreferNoSchedule → The scheduler will try to avoid placing pods but won’t force it.
NoExecute → Already running pods without a toleration will be evicted.

-- Create Tolerations
Inside Pod yaml add line tolerations
tolerations:
  - key: "environment"
    operator: "Equal"
    value: "production"
    effect: "NoSchedule"
