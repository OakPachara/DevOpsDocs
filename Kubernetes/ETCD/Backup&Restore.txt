# ETCD is key-value database
# etcdctl is a command line client for ETCD.

ETCD pod name (by default) = get pod etcd-controlplane -n kube-system

Important ETCD info
We can find them in "describe pod etcd-controlplan -n kube-system"
or
cat /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml #This is real manifests file
if this file was updated it will restart ETCD automatically

Image version | grep image
ETCD endpoints | grep --listen-client-urls
ETCD server certificate file located | grep --cert-file
ETCD CA Certificate file located | grep --trusted-ca-file 
ETCD server key file located | grep --key-file

---------------------------------
Task a ETCD snapshot
ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl 
--endpoints=https://127.0.0.1:2379 \
--cacert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt \
--cert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt \
--key=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.key \
snapshot save {save path eg: /opt/snapshot-pre-boot.db}

--------------------------------
Restore ETCD data
ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl  \
--data-dir /var/lib/etcd-{add another name} \
snapshot restore {snapshot saved path }

#Note 
By default --data-dir value is /var/lib/etcd
We suppose to change it to the new file while restoring process
if --data-dir value is changed
Go to ETCD manifests files "/etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml"
Then change
1
--data-dir = {new path} 
2
 volumes:
  - hostPath:
      path: {new path}
      type: DirectoryOrCreate
    name: etcd-data
3
 volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: {new path}
      name: etcd-data

#Note if the ETCD doesn't have manifests file,ETCD might be installed in systemd
Go edit value at 
 vim /etc/systemd/system/etcd.service
And restart the service
 systemctl daemon-reload
 systemctl restart etcd
 system status etcd
