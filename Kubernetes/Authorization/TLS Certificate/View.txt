We can see Certifiactes of each component by look as its configs

If Kebernetes is installed via "kubeadm"
By defaults every configuration are located inside 
/etc/kubernetes/manifests/{service name}.yaml

Whereas if it's installed manually, it would located as "systemd"
/etc/systemd/system/{service name}.service

____________________________________
For example if we want to know about API server certification
cat /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml | grep "--tls-cert-file"

then decode the certificate file
openssl x509 -in {certificate.crt} -text -noout
