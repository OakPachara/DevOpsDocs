#To see the existing routing configuration on a system
 route

#adds a static route to the system's routing table. 
ip route add 192.168.2.0/24 via 192.168.1.1
#192.168.2.0/24: This is the destination network (i.e., any IP from 192.168.2.0 to 192.168.2.255).
#via 192.168.1.1: This tells the system to send traffic for the destination network through the gateway at IP address 192.168.1.1.
#Summary
#This command configures the system so that any traffic destined for the 192.168.2.0/24 
network will be forwarded to 192.168.1.1

-----------------------------------------
#adds a default route
ip route add default via 192.168.2.1
#All outbound traffic that doesnâ€™t match any existing route will be sent to 192.168.2.1, which is expected to forward it appropriately

-----------------------------------------
Example

We have HostA connect to Network 192.168.1.0 with IP 192.168.1.5 
We have HostB connect to Network both 192.168.1.0 and 192.168.2.0
  and have IP on both Network
  192.168.1.6 for Network 192.168.1.0
  192.168.2.6 for Network 192.168.2.0
We have HostC connect to Network 192.168.2.0 With IP 192.168.2.5

How to make the connection between A and C

We can't use HostA pinging to HostC at first
ping 192.168.2.5  #"Connect: Network is unreachable"

We have add routing table to both of them first
ip route add 192.168.2.0/24 via 192.168.1.6
ip route add 192.168.1.0/24 via 192.168.2.6

#Now we can use HostA pinging to HostC
ping 192.168.2.5
#But we can find any response yet, We have to explicitly allow HostB
#to forward packets
cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward #result=0
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward  # replace 0 to 1
---
vim /etc/sysctl.cong  #set net.ipv4.ip_forward =1
